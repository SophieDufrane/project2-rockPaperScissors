# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

## Website:

This website's purpose is to offer a game, based on the famous Rock Paper Scissors one. 
The game has 2 other options with Lizard and Spock: this version was invented by Sam Kass and this is also a fun allusion to the TV show "Big Bang Theory" where the game is mentioned several times.

- __Footer__

    - This section is structured as a resume and starts with a job title "Full-Stack Developer".
    - Then there's a brief introduction or pitch, and finally a picture. 
    - There's a button "Contact Me!" right below the text, it's also a shortcut to go to the contact page and access to the form.
    - The button has a contrasted color to make it evident and easy to see. Getting in contact with users (potential recruiters) would be the main purpose of this website.

## Other tools used:
- The footer icons and the Menu icon on the navbar were taken from **Font Awesome**.

## Testing:

- I've tested the website on Chrome and Firefox, I also used Chrome developer tools to check responsiveness.
- I have used a mobile and different devises to see how the website looks like on different screen sizes.
- I have tested the form and check if all the required fields are set-up correctly.
- I have clicked on all footer icones to see if the correct pages open in a new tab. Same with the Menu, and buttons.
- I confirmed that the Website and its functionnalities are working on all devises tested.

- Lighthouse
    - Performance was the main issue that had to be fixed on both "Portfolio" and "Contact" pages. It was at 69% first, then resizing the images improved the performance that is now 90%
    - Accessibility was at 92% on the "Home page". To fix the issue, I've changed the boxes colors and this has improved the score that is now 95%.
    - Best practices is 100%
    - SEO is 100%

### Improvements:

The About-me section could have a better look on screens 768px and bigger, the title "About Me" looks slightly disconnected from the rest of the section. 
I removed the bottom-margin of the h2 on bigger screens to improve the visual, however I think this can be improved to make the visual more consistent.

## Deployment:
- The site was deployed to GitHub following the steps below:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
    - In the "Pages" menu, from the "Source" dropdown list, select "Deploy from a Branch".
